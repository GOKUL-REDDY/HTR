# Download PyTesseract


WARNING: Tesseract should be either installed in the directory which is suggested during the installation or in a new directory. The uninstaller removes the whole installation directory. If you installed Tesseract in an existing directory, that directory will be removed with all its subdirectories and files.

The latest installers can be downloaded here:

    tesseract-ocr-w32-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20200328.exe (32 bit) and
    tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20200328.exe (64 bit) resp.

We don't provide an installer for Tesseract 4.1.0 because we think that the latest version 5.0.0-alpha is better for most Windows users in many aspects (functionality, speed, stability). Version 4.1 is only needed for people who develop software based on the Tesseract API and who need 100 % API compatibility with version 4.0.

Handwritten text recognition is basically we can see it in our CamScanner App which we use daily.In that app they used OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and Normal fast recognition which doesn’t have accuracy at all.But while using OCR its working, But not completely.So I started with OCR to get text recognized,but I faced many problems using that.. like API key and Money to be paid,then I decided to go offline then I found the “PY TESSERACT '' which is an Optical Character Recognition(OCR) tool for Python. Together they can be used to read the contents of a section of the screen. And further application in NLP(Natural Language Processing) also helps a lot.  Hence, I worked on this Py Tesseract and got the results which are almost accurate and much better when compared to CamScanner fast recognition
