Handwritten text recognition is basically we can see it in our CamScanner App which we use daily.In that app they used OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and Normal fast recognition which doesn’t have accuracy at all.But while using OCR its working, But not completely.So I started with OCR to get text recognized,but I faced many problems using that.. like API key and Money to be paid,then I decided to go offline then I found the “PY TESSERACT '' which is an Optical Character Recognition(OCR) tool for Python. Together they can be used to read the contents of a section of the screen. And further application in NLP(Natural Language Processing) also helps a lot.  Hence, I worked on this Py Tesseract and got the results which are almost accurate and much better when compared to CamScanner fast recognition
